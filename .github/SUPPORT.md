# Support

WebGrid is a project mostly maintained by developers in their free-time â€” for this reason there is limited availability to address general support questions. If you have an issue, make sure you are using the [latest stable release](https://github.com/TilBlechschmidt/WebGrid/releases).

When looking for support, please first search for your question in these venues:

- [Documentation and FAQ](https://webgrid.dev/faq/)
- [Open **and** closed issues](https://github.com/TilBlechschmidt/WebGrid/issues?q=is%3Aissue) on GitHub
- [#support](https://discord.gg/yYaPcNM) text channel on our Discord server

If you didn't find an answer in the resources above, you can ask your question using one of the following channels â€” depending on the type of question.


## General support question

If you have a general or technical support question please **do not** use GitHub Issues! It is used for bug reports and feature requests. Instead consider asking your question on the [official Discord](https://discord.gg/yYaPcNM) `#support` channel, mentioning one of the maintainers.

## Undocumented features & conceptual questions

If you have a question about a possibly undocumented feature or other conceptual concepts/ideas please open a [bare-bones ticket](https://github.com/TilBlechschmidt/WebGrid/issues/new) on Github. Again, **do not** abuse this for general support questions but rather if you have a question whose answer could fit into the documentation.
