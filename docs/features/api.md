# API

The grid exposes an API which provides read-only access to the status and metadata of sessions and some other internal components which might be of interest. It uses the [GraphQL](https://graphql.org) query language to provide predictable and typed responses and is available under the following URL:

```
http://<your-webgrid-address>/api
```

!!! tip
    When opening the API in a browser, a GraphQL Playground opens up which provides syntax highlighting, code completion and a complete documentation!
