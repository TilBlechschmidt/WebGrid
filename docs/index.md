<!-- Bullet points -->
* **Cluster ready.** Designed with concurrency, on-demand scalability and cluster operation in mind
* **Debuggable.** Provides browser screen recordings and extensive logs
* **Resilient.** Built with automatic error recovery at its core
* **[W3C Specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/webdriver1/) compilant.** Fully compatible with existing Selenium clients

---

## Install

Below are quick-start tutorials to get you started. For a more detailed guide visit the dedicated [Getting Started guide](https://webgrid.dev/getting-started/)!

### üê≥ Docker

To run a basic grid in Docker you can use Docker Compose. Below is a bare-bones example of getting all required components up and running!

```bash
# Create prerequisites
docker volume create webgrid
docker network create webgrid

# Download compose file
curl -fsSLO https://webgrid.dev/docker-compose.yml

# Launch the grid
docker-compose up
```

You can now point your Selenium client to [`localhost:8080`](http://localhost/) and browse the API at [`/api`](http://localhost/api).

### ‚ò∏Ô∏è Kube

For deployment to Kubernetes a Helm repository is available. The default values provide a good starting point for basic cluster setups like [K3s](https://k3s.io) or [microk8s](https://microk8s.io).

```bash
# Add the repository
helm repo add webgrid https://webgrid.dev/

# Install the chart
helm install example webgrid/webgrid

# Make it accessible locally for evaluation
kubectl port-forward service/example-webgrid 8080:80
```

Your grid is now available at the [`localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080/) service.

If you are deploying to a RBAC enabled cluster you might have to tweak some settings. Take a look at the [documentation](https://webgrid.dev/kubernetes/configuration/) on how to use your own ServiceAccount and PersistentVolumeClaims.

## Usage

Once you have your grid up and running there is a couple of things you can do!

### üöÄ Launch browser instances

Point your selenium client to [`http://localhost:8080`](http://localhost:8080) to create a new browser container/pod and interact with it! You can use all features supported by Selenium.

### üîç Browse the API

The grid provides a GraphQL API at [`/api`](http://localhost:8080/api) with a Playground for you to explore. It exposes all available metadata about sessions, grid health and advanced features like video recordings.

### üì∫ Watch your browsers

You can take a **live** look at what your browsers are doing by taking the [Session ID](https://webgrid.dev/features/screen-recording/#session-id) of a instance and visiting `localhost:8080/embed/<session-id>`. You can also embed the videos in your existing tools! Head over to the <a href="(https://webgrid.dev/features/screen-recording/#embedding">embedding documentation</a> to learn how.

!!! warning "Screen recordings in clusters"
    Video recordings are disabled by default in K8s as every cluster has specific requirements for file storage. The <a href="https://webgrid.dev/kubernetes/storage/">storage documentation</a> explains how to enable it.

## Developing

If you want to build the project locally you can use the [Makefile](https://github.com/TilBlechschmidt/WebGrid/blob/main/Makefile). To create Docker images for every component and run them locally run these commands:

```bash
# Build docker images
make

# Start components in docker
make install
```

To start individual components outside of Docker or setup the development environment, see the [development environment documentation](https://webgrid.dev/contribute/dev-environment/).
