# Issue reporting

Creating an issue is the easiest way to contribute to the project! All issues are tracked using the [GitHub Issue Board](https://github.com/TilBlechschmidt/WebGrid/issues). There are four different types of issues:

| Type                                                             | Description                                                                       |
|------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ![Bug](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Bug-red)                    | Issues that affect the functionality of the software                              |
| ![Enhancement](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Enhancement-blue)   | Feature requests or ideas that would improve the project                          |
| ![Maintenance](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Maintenance-yellow) | Improvements to code quality, readability, documentation or architecture          |
| ![Question](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Question-purple)       | General questions about the project, how it works and for non-documented features |

## Reporting

If you have a question, encountered a bug or want to suggest a feature **please don't hesitate to [open a ticket](https://github.com/TilBlechschmidt/WebGrid/issues/new)** â€” Community feedback helps the project grow and adapt in the best possible way!

!!! important "Preventing duplicates"
    Make sure to browse the [issue backlog](https://github.com/TilBlechschmidt/WebGrid/issues?q=is%3Aopen) and [previously closed issues](https://github.com/TilBlechschmidt/WebGrid/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+) as well as the [FAQ](../faq.md) to see if somebody else already covered your topic! This helps us focus on implementing your ideas and helping you with issues instead of housekeeping duplicates.

## Lifecycle

Each ticket goes through the following lifecycle outlined below:

```mermaid
stateDiagram
	[*] --> Pending

	Pending --> Available
	Pending --> Accepted

	Accepted --> Available

	Available --> InProgress
	InProgress --> Completed

	InProgress --> Abandoned
	Pending --> Abandoned
	Accepted --> Abandoned
    Pending --> Duplicate


    Completed --> [*]
    Abandoned --> [*]

```

In addition to the states shown above, it may enter one of the following states from almost any other state:
