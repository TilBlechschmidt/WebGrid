Following the guidelines outlined on the next few pages helps us focusing on maintaining and developing this project and allowing more time to assist you with your contributions. So please spent the time to read the sections that correspond to your area of contribution carefully!

WebGrid is an open source project and we love to receive contributions from our community â€” you! There are many ways to contribute, from writing tutorials or blog posts, improving the documentation, submitting bug reports and feature requests or writing code which can be incorporated into WebGrid itself. If you are unsure how to contribute to a open source project in general, take a look at [this resource](https://www.firsttimersonly.com) or [this one](http://makeapullrequest.com/).

If you find yourself wishing for a feature that doesn't exist in WebGrid, you are probably not alone. There are bound to be others out there with similar needs. Many of the features that WebGrid has today have been added because our users saw the need. Open an issue on our [issues list on GitHub](https://github.com/TilBlechschmidt/WebGrid/issues/new) which describes the feature you would like to see, why you need it, and how it should work.

Lastly, please be nice to everyone! You can read the code of conduct [here](./code-of-conduct.md), please adhere to it we really don't want to get out the ban-hammer.
